This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:




#Loading and preprocessing the data
Load the data from the csv file

```{r}
rawData <- read.csv("data/activity.csv")
```


Transforms the data into a format more suitable for analysis

```{r}
rawData$date <- as.Date(rawData$date)
```

# Mean total number of steps taken per day
Calculate the total number of steps taken per day and save the results into a different data set "dailySummary"

```{r}
dailySummary <- aggregate(steps ~ date, rawData, sum)
colnames(dailySummary) <- c("date", "steps")
```

Histogram plot of the number of steps taken each day. A histogram counts the frequency

```{r}
hist(dailySummary$steps, col = 'red', breaks = 20 )
```

The mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day are below
```{r}
mean(dailySummary$steps)
median(dailySummary$steps)
```



# Average daily activity pattern

Aggregate the pattern for a day and draw the plot
```{r}
dailyMean = aggregate(steps ~ interval, rawData, mean)
```

Draw the line plot to show the relationship
```{r}

plot(dailyMean$interval, dailyMean$steps, type = "l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average Steps", main = "Average daily activity pattern")
```

Find the 5 minute interval, on average across all days which contains the maximum number of steps
```{r}
max <- dailyMean[dailyMean$steps==max(dailyMean$steps),]
max
```

The 5 minute interval that gives the amount of steps is **`r max$interval`** with **`r max$step`** steps

# Inputing missing values

Calculate the number of missing values in the data set
```{r}
missingRows <- nrow(subset(rawData, is.na(rawData$steps)))
missingRows
```
